\section{Introduction}
These exercises offer a practical introduction to some machine learning concepts using KNN and MNIST. Will revisit this later as I'm currently more concerned with the theoretical stuff.
\subsection{KNN classifier on shuffled MNIST data}
Takes about 19:47 minutes to run on my computer and achieves a test set accuracy of 96.61\%.
\subsection{Approximate KNN classifiers}
Cool idea. [TODO]
\subsection{CV for KNN}
5-fold leave one out cross validation predicts 96.94\% accuracy. Takes 1:30:45 hours to run in total.
